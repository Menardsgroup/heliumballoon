## GoPro Fusion360
Other than following the manual, note:
1. The camera needs TWO SD cards at all times, one for front, one for back camera
2. Because the pixels are spread across 360 degrees, the resolution will be low
3. Do not attempt to process the videos with Fusion Studio (a software you can use to render 3D videos on your laptop) at 5K; 
a 35 second video took 10 minutes to finish rendering and 2.3GB on disk (after rendering).
